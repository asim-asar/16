    <h1>Why do some NBA players make so much money?</h1>
    <div class = "text">
        <p>Over the past several decades, NBA salaries have gone through the roof. As seen below, the average salary has increased by about 15x since the mid-80s. The globalization of the league and increased sponsorships have led to some superstar players signing yearly deals worth tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>In this analysis, we will explore the factors that contribute to how much a player earns in order to better understand what the league values most in its players.</p>

    <h1>Which NBA player features have the highest correlation with their salaries?</h1>

                <p>To start our analysis, we first wanted to explore which features are the best indicator of how much a player will be paid. We selected 5 variables that we felt were the best measures of a player's value.</p>
                <p>Points Per Game (PPG) had the highest positive correlation with salary (r ≈ 0.73). Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) had the second highest (r ≈ 0.68) and Win Shares (WS) came in third (r ≈ 0.58).</p>
                <p>While PPG was the clear winner, all 3 of these variables demonstrated a strong positive correlation with salary and seemed promising to explore.</p>
