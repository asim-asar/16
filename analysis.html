<h1>Which players have contracts that don't align with their production?</h1>
<div class = "text">
    <p>The scatterplot below shows every player's 2022-23 salary as well as how many points per game they averaged (PPG). Players in the green "undervalued" quadrant were above league average in PPG and below league average in salary, and vice versa for players in the red "overvalued" quadrant. Sizes are based on the individual's PPG.</p>
    <p>Each point shows the player's name, salary, PPG, and age. Looking at the players in the under and overvalued category reveals a general trend of early 20s players outperforming relative to their contracts, whereas overrvalued players tend to be in their late 20s/early 30s.</p>
