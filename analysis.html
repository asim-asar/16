<h1>Which NBA player features have the highest correlation with their salaries?</h1>

            <p>To start our analysis, we first wanted to explore which features are the best indicator of how much a player will be paid. We selected 5 variables that we felt were the best measures of a player's value.</p>
            <p>Points Per Game (PPG) had the highest positive correlation with salary (r ≈ 0.73). Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) had the second highest (r ≈ 0.68) and Win Shares (WS) came in third (r ≈ 0.58).</p>
            <p>While PPG was the clear winner, all of the chosen variables demonstrated a positive correlation with salary, so we decided to explore them all to see what we could find.</p>
